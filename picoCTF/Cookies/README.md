The challenge reads: *Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one.*

Using inspect element, navigate to storage, and then cookies. You should see a cookie already set with the value of -1. enter in "snickerdoodle" as it prompts and we get the text *"That is a cookie! Not very special though..."* and, *"I love snickerdoodle cookies!"*. Change the cookie value to 18 to get the flag.
