We are given:

*"Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition"*

Using inspect element we can see the POST and GET requests corresponding to each button. The title of the challenge leads us to believe we also need to use a HEAD request to get the answer. 

In the terminal type: **curl -I HEAD -i mercury.picoctf.net:34561** to preform a HEAD request from the url provided. 

This returns the flag: **picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_8f878508}**
